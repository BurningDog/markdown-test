## Teacher Guided Activity 1

### Lesson plan 1

* **Topic:** Me
* **Theme:** What makes me different?
* **Objective:** To discover what makes me special.

### Activity

* Let the learners sit on the carpet and tell them that you are going to talk about what makes us all different and special. Ask the learners to talk about what they know. They can start the discussion by talking about what makes us all similar.  
* Emphasise diversity and the uniqueness of every person.
* Discuss each child's features:
  * How many hands do you have? How many fingers?
  * How many eyes? What colour?
  * How many ears do I have?
  * How many feet do you have? How many toes?
* Talk about different names, languages and gender. All of this makes us different. Discuss that we are all perfect just the way we are. Remind learners that it is important to respect the differences in the people around us.
* Allow each child to stand up, tell the class their name, gender and home language.
